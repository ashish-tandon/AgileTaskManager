# Agile Task Management Project

This is a simple task management application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project follows agile principles to enhance collaboration, flexibility, and responsiveness in the development process.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- **style.css:** The CSS file for styling the web page.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file for handling the logic of the task management application.
- **README.md:** This file.

## Agile Principles in Action

### 1. User Stories

User stories were used to define the functionality of the task management application. Here's an example user story:

"As a user, I want to add a task so that I can keep track of my to-do list."

### 2. Iterations

The development process followed iterative cycles, with continuous integration of features. Each iteration focused on delivering a set of user stories, ensuring a working version of the application at the end of each cycle.

### 3. Feedback Loops

Regular feedback loops were established, allowing stakeholders to provide input throughout the development process. User feedback helped refine and improve the application, ensuring it meets the user's needs effectively.
